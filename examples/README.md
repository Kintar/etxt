# etxt examples
This folder contains two subfolders:
- `gtxt` is the main examples folder. The code uses the generic **etxt** version (`-tags gtxt`), but the techniques showcased have general applicability. This folder contains many simple examples that will help you get started. Almost all the `gtxt` examples expect one argument with a path to the font to use.
- `ebiten` contains examples on how to use **etxt** with Ebiten. The examples are mostly advanced, including animation effects, shaders and similar. I recommend starting with the examples in `gtxt` instead.

Below you can see the results of a few examples:
